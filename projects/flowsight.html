      <h3>Decision Intelligence Layer</h3>
      <p>
        FlowSight embeds decision logic directly into analytics pipelines,
        correlating funnel behavior with downstream impact and priority
        signals so teams act with clarity instead of debate.

      <p>
        The architecture is modular by design. New events, experiments, and
        cohorts can be introduced without breaking existing logic, ensuring
        scalability as product complexity increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        By aligning analytics with execution, FlowSight reduces cognitive
        load, eliminates metric ambiguity, and accelerates decision velocity
        across product, growth, and operations teams.
